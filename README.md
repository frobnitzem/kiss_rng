# KISS random number generator

This is a SYCL C++ adaptation of the KISS random number
generation algorithm.  Credit for the original (CUDA) implementation
goes to [@sleepyjack](https://github.com/sleeepyjack/kiss_rng).


Its usage inside a kernel is demonstrated by `example/example.cpp`:

    #include <kiss/kiss.hpp>

    ...

    using Rng = kiss::Kiss<std::uint64_t>;

    cgh.parallel_for(sycl::nd_range({4096, 32}),
          [=](sycl::nd_item<1> it) {
        const std::uint32_t tid = it.get_global_id(0);

        // generate initial local seed per thread
        const std::uint32_t local_seed =
            kiss::hashers::MurmurHash<std::uint32_t>::hash(seed+tid);

        Rng rng{local_seed};

        // grid-stride loop
        const auto grid_stride = it.get_global_range(0);
        for(std::uint64_t i = tid; i < n; i += grid_stride) {
            // generate random element and write to output
            out[i] = rng.template next<T>();
        }
    });

The following template combinations work:

  * `Kiss<uint32_t>` . `next<uint32_t>`, `next<float>`, and `next<double>`

  * `Kiss<uint64_t>` . `next<uint64_t>`

The float and real output types return values in the half-open
interval `[0,1)`.


# Installing

There are no dependencies for this package other than a SYCL compiler.
Since it is a header-only library, you may either copy the `include/kiss`
subdirectory into an appropriate include path, or else ask cmake
to do it for you with something like,

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which syclcc` \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
          ..
    make install

The example can then be built with,

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which syclcc` \
          -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local \
          ..
    make
